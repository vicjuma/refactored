                            <p>We assess refund requests on a case-by-case basis as there are usually unique reasons why a refund request is made. Unsatisfactory answers are answers that are either overdue, or fail to follow the instructions outlined in the question's description. If you receive an unsatisfactory answer, the first thing you should do is ask the tutor to revise the answer. If this does not resolve your dispute and you feel it necessary to make a refund request, contact support team with the reason for your refund request and explain why the answer is unsatisfactory. Please note, we may require documented proof that the quality of your order is low. The support agent will go over the answer to see if it meets the requirements and our internal guidelines for quality. If the answer do not meet the requirements, the student's money are refunded. We offer 10 days to request a refund in case you were dissatisfied with the answer. Once the Refund Period elapses, we will not refund any amounts paid.</p>
